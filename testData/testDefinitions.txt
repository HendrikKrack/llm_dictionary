machine learning [DEF] Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of soft computing within computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence.
genetic algorithm [DEF] In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA).
classification [DEF] A classification is a division or category in a system which divides things into groups or types.
deep learning [DEF] Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
data mining [DEF] Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.
cloud computing [DEF] Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet.
support vector machine [DEF] A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.
clustering [DEF] Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
model check [DEF] In computer science, model checking or property checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification (also known as correctness).
security [DEF] Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
optimization [DEF] Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives.
feature selection [DEF] In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction.
neural network [DEF] A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
multiagent system [DEF] A multiagent system (MAS) is a paradigm in the computer sciences and related areas where a system of interest is conceived as a set of autonomous entities called agents, as well as its interaction mechanisms.
simulation [DEF] A computer simulation (or "sim") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works.
neural networks [DEF] Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs), are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
artificial intelligence [DEF] Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.
ontology [DEF] An ontology is a kind of dictionary that describes information in a certain domain using concepts and relationships.In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse.
wireless sensor network [DEF] Wireless sensor network (WSN) refers to a group of spatially dispersed and dedicated sensors for monitoring and recording the physical conditions of the environment and organizing the collected data at a central location.
logic program [DEF] Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic.
virtual reality [DEF] Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation in which a person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with sensors.
particle swarm optimization [DEF] In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.
